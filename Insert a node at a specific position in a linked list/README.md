# Insert a node at a specific position in a linked list

Source: [Link](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/insert-a-node-at-a-specific-position-in-a-linked-list/problem)

## Task:

Youâ€™re given the pointer to the head node of a linked list, an integer to add to the list and the position at which the
integer must be inserted. Create a new node with the given integer, insert this node at the desired position and return
the head node.

A position of 0 indicates head, a position of 1 indicates one node away from the head and so on. 
The head pointer given may be null meaning that the initial list is empty.

As an example, if your list starts as `1 -> 2 -> 3` and you want to insert a node at position `2` with `data = 4`, 
your new list should be `1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3`

**Function Description**
Complete the function insertNodeAtPosition in the editor below. It must return a reference to the head node of your
finished list.

insertNodeAtPosition has the following parameters:

* head: a SinglyLinkedListNode pointer to the head of the list
* data: an integer value to insert as data in your new node
* position: an integer position to insert the new node, zero based indexing

**Input Format**

The first line contains an integer `n`, the number of elements in the linked list.
Each of the next `n` lines contains an integer `SinglyLinkedListNode[i].data`.
The last line contains an integer `position`.

**Constraints**

* `1 <= n <= 1000`
* `1 <= SinglyLinkedListNode[i].data <= 1000`, where `SinglyLinkedListNode[i]` is the `i(th)` element of 
the linked list.
* `1 <= list[i] <= 1000`

**Output Format**

Return a reference to the list head. Locked code prints the list for you.

**Sample Input**

```
3
16
13
7
1
2
```

**Sample Output**
```
16 13 1 7
```
