Source: [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)

## Task:

Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the 
new length.

**Example 1:**

```
Given nums = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

**Example 2**
```
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```

**Sample Input**

```
[1,1,2]
```

**Sample Output**
```
2
```
