## Task:

There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

```
findUniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) === 2
findUniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) === 0.55
```

Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains more than 3 numbers.

The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.

**Sample Input**

```
[ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]
```

**Sample Output**
```
2
```
