#Odd or Even

## Task:

You need to write a function that reverses the words in a given string. A word can also fit an empty string.
If this is not clear enough, here are some examples:

As the input may have trailing spaces, you will also need to ignore unnecessary whitespace.

```
reverse("Hello World") === "World Hello"
reverse("Hi There.") === "There. Hi"
```
