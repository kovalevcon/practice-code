# Disemvowel Trolls

Source: [Link](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52fba66badcd10859f00097e/train/javascript)

## Task:

Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing 
the threat.

Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string `"This website is for losers LOL!"` would become `"Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!"`.

Note: for this kata `y` isn't considered a vowel.

**Sample Input**

```
This website is for losers LOL!
```

**Sample Output**
```
Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!
```
