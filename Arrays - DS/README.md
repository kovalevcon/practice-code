# Arrays - DS

Source: [Link](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/arrays-ds/problem)

## Task:

An array is a type of data structure that stores elements of the same type in a contiguous block of memory. In an array,
`A`, of size `N`, each memory location has some unique index, `i` (where `0 <= i < N`), that can be referenced as `A[i]`
(you may also see it written as `Ai`).

Given an array, `A`, of `N` integers, print each element in reverse order as a single line of space-separated integers.

**Input format**

The first line contains an integer, `N` (the number of integers in `A`).
The second line contains `N` space-separated integers describing `A`.

**Constraints**

* `1 <= N <= pow(10, 3)`
* `1 <= Ai <= pow(10, 4)`, where `Ai` is the `Ith` integer in `A`

**Output format**

Print all `N` integers in `A` in reverse order as a single line of space-separated integers.

**Sample Input**

```
4
1 4 3 2
```

**Sample Output**

```
2 3 4 1
```
