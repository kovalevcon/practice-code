# Implement strStr()

Source: [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-strstr/)

## Task:

Implement `strStr()`.

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or `-1` if needle is not part of haystack.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2
```


**Example 2:**

```
Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
Output: -1
```

**Clarification:**

What should we return when `needle` is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when `needle` is an empty string.
This is consistent to C's `strstr()` and Java's `indexOf()`.

**Sample Input**

```
'hello', 'll'
```

**Sample Output**
```
2
```
